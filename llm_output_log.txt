### ANALYSIS ###
The candidate demonstrated a significant lack of understanding of basic technical concepts in Full Stack Development. Their responses to questions about monolithic architecture, microservices architecture, OOP principles, RESTful APIs, and data validation were unclear and lacked any meaningful insight. The candidate's inability to provide coherent answers to fundamental questions raises concerns about their ability to handle more complex technical challenges in a real-world setting.
